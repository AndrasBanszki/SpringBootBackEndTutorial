You have to create a prototype backend interface which will help the UI developers.
Make a REST service, which will give back JSON formatted objects for requests.

The UI team is collected the following specifications.
1. Get passanger number for a specified flight .
	key(s): 
		- flight id
	response should have:
		- number of passanger
2. Get all flight for a passanger.
	key(s): 
		- passanger id
	response should have:
		- list of the following objects (flight id, date_of_departure, date_of_arrival, departure_airport_id, arrival_airport_id)
3. Get data of a plane for a specified flight.
	key(s):
		- flight id
	response should have:
		- max_speed, number_of_staff, number_of_passanger, max_cargo_weight, plane_weight

Recommended technologies/skills to be use:
- Spring (SpringBoot and other projects)
- REST interface
- GitHub

Example project to help you to start the developments:

Also to try out any of your REST endpoint I recommend the PostMan app.
